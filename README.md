# AI/Human Text Classification Project

## Description
This repository hosts a project dedicated to classifying text as either generated by AI or written by humans. The project aims to delve into distinguishing features between AI-generated texts and human writings, leveraging advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques. It encompasses the entire workflow from data collection to model training and evaluation, offering insights into the capabilities and limitations of current AI in replicating human text. The project is structured into Data and Code directories for organized access to resources and findings.

## Table of Contents
- [Code](./Code/)
- [Data](./Data/)

## [Code](./Code/)
The Code folder houses all the Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks essential for the project. This includes code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation. Specific scripts for text vectorization, model architecture design, training routines, and performance analysis are detailed, offering a comprehensive look into the project's technical backbone.

## [Data](./Data/)
The Data directory contains the datasets used for training and testing the models. It provides a mixture of AI-generated and human-written texts, meticulously prepared and annotated to facilitate the classification task. Additional details on data sourcing, preprocessing steps, and the final dataset structure are included, alongside a data dictionary to clarify the attributes of the data used.

## About the Project
This project is an exploration into the intersection of artificial intelligence and linguistics, seeking to shed light on how machines can mimic human language and the distinguishable patterns that set them apart. It's a step towards understanding the broader implications of AI in content creation and the challenges in identifying AI-generated texts in the wild.
